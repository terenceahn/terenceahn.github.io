# MatrixSolver

## Overview
This project is a Java program that uses Gaussian elimination to solve systems of equations in augmented matrix form. The main file is `MatrixSolver.java`.

## Features
- Solves systems of linear equations with unique solutions.
- Reads input using the `StdIn` library.
- Some outputs use the `StdOut` library.

## Instructions
If you have: 
x+2y+z=2
3x+8y+z=12
4y+z=2

You can represent it as:
1 2 1 2
3 8 1 12
0 4 1 2

When you run the code, it will ask you how many rows and columns you want to input. In this case, it would be 3 rows and 4 columns. Then you will be prompted to declare the numbers in order from left to right then top to bottom.
